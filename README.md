# DOG AGING PROJECT PUBLICATION RESOURCES GITHUB REPOSITORY

ABOUT THIS REPO: This repository serves as the central hub for storing datasets and code files associated with research publications authored by the Dog Aging Project consortium. **These data represent currently embargoed Dog Aging Project data and are provided for the sole purpose of replicating published analyses in cases where the research publication uses currently embargoed data and the journal explicitly requires sharing of all data used.** In all other cases, readers should be directed to the standard DAP Curated Data via [dogagingproject.org/data-access/](https://dogagingproject.org/data-access). Manuscripts should specify how DAP Curated Data were subset for the analyses.

GUIDE TO REPO ACTIONS: This repository is designed to simplify contributions by providing an automated process that creates a standardized folder structure for each manuscript. Each new submission generates a dedicated folder—with clearly defined subdirectories for code and data—ensuring that all uploads adhere to consistent naming conventions and organization. Leveraging GitHub Actions, the workflow captures essential publication details from the contributor and automatically commits the structured folders to the repository. This approach not only streamlines the submission process for users with minimal GitHub experience but also maintains uniformity and reliability across all publication assets.

**If you are a member of the DAP team and you need to upload data files to this repo, please reach out to DAP Data Manager Mandy Kauffman at mekauffm@uw.edu. She will set up a folder structure for you and give you access.**

**IMPORTANT**: Datasets uploaded to this repo must meet the following criteria:

* Datasets should represent DAP data still under embargo or otherwise unavailable through Curated Data Release. 
* Datasets should not be simply subsets of data already contained within Terra. In these cases, the manuscript should direct readers to a standard Curated Data Release and specify appropriate subsetting of the data.
* Datasets should contain only the minimum amount of data necessary for replication of the analyses reported in the manuscript. 
* Datasets should include dog_id to enable users to link to DAP Curated Data.
* Datasets must be completely scrubbed of personally identifiable information (PII) and/or personal health information (PHI). 
* Datasets should not contain any geographic or location data. Even if information about participant addresses was utilized in analyses, these data must be withheld. 

**If you have any questions about how to structure your data and/or what to include/exclude from your dataset, please discuss with DAP Data Manager Mandy Kauffman at mekauffm@uw.edu.**

NOTE ON SECURITY: This is a public repository. While DAP can restrict who has “write access” to the repository, anyone can download or create a fork (i.e. a duplicate of the repository contents) to obtain copies of and/or make changes to that copy of these data without having signed a DAP Data Use Agreement. This means they have access to your hard-earned DAP data without ever seeing or agreeing to DAP data use policies. Please ensure that you fully understand the implications and that sharing data via this repository is truly absolutely necessary for your publication.
